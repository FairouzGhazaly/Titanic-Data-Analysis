# Titanic Data Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a thorough analysis of the Titanic passenger dataset, aiming to uncover the underlying factors that influenced survival during the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic. By applying a structured data science workflow, the project begins with data exploration to understand the distribution and characteristics of various features such as passenger demographics, ticket classes, and fares paid.

The analysis addresses challenges such as missing data, especially in crucial columns like age and deck, by implementing appropriate data cleaning and imputation techniques. Categorical variables are encoded to facilitate statistical analysis and modeling, while continuous variables are normalized to improve comparability.

A series of visualizations—including bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps—are generated to highlight key patterns, such as the survival rates segmented by gender, passenger class, and age groups. Special attention is given to analyzing the impact of family connections aboard (siblings/spouses and parents/children), ports of embarkation, and fare prices on survival outcomes.

The project answers fifteen targeted analytical questions that not only explore survival probabilities but also investigate demographic and socioeconomic factors shaping the fate of passengers. These insights provide a data-driven perspective that could simulate decision-making scenarios related to risk and survival likelihood.

Overall, this comprehensive study combines statistical techniques and data visualization to transform raw historical data into actionable knowledge, demonstrating the power of data analysis in uncovering hidden stories behind well-known events.

## Dataset Details
The Titanic dataset encompasses detailed passenger information including:

- Survival status (0 = did not survive, 1 = survived)  
- Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd) indicating socioeconomic status  
- Gender and age demographics  
- Number of siblings/spouses and parents/children aboard  
- Fare paid for the journey  
- Port of embarkation with categorical codes for Cherbourg, Queenstown, and Southampton  
- Additional descriptive features such as passenger type ("who"), deck level, and travel companionship ("alone").

Missing values are present primarily in the age and deck columns, which required thoughtful imputation to ensure analytical robustness.
